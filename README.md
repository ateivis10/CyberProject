# Encrypted Chatting System
Live link: ecs09.netlify.app

N.B. [This a php project, which is fully functional, this repository contains all the functional files on php. But to showcase this project with a livelink, I converted the project
to Js with the same functionalities. To see the functionalities of the project using the livelink you have to register at least two accounts first.]

This is a simple web based chatting application for Computer and Cyber Security course to demonstrate some ciphering algorithms.
In this project, We can register new users using gmail and password, login providing gmail address and password. Then in the home page, it shows all the registered users.
We have to select a user to start a conversation. Then we can send messages to different users. The messages are stored and displayed from a database table.

The main feature of this project is, we can send secret messages using different encryption/decryption algorithms. 
In this project I have used two cipher techniques namely- Autokey and Playfair cipher. The user can send secret messages by clicking on the secret message checkbox.
Then they have to provide their message, choose algorithm between Autokey and Playfair and provide the key to encrypt the message and then simply click on Send to
send the message.
Then the receiver can only view the secret message after providing the ciphering technique name and the KEY, without these he can't see the original message.
The other texts are displayed normally.
